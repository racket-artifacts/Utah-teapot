# Utah-teapot
Utah teapot rendered with Pict3d


Here is something to get you started.

Save the model in the same folder.

The documentation of pict3d is here: https://docs.racket-lang.org/pict3d/quick.html?q=pict3d

If you are using DrRacket then replace the last line (that turns the model into a bitmap) with p. DrRacket will then show the model directly in the repl and you can use arrow keys to rotate the model.
